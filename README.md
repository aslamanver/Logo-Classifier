* Setup

  You will need to install Tensorflow and Python on your Machine.
  To install tensorflow, hit the following in the terminal:
  
      sudo apt-get install python3-tk
      sudo apt-get install python-tk
      
      pip install tensorflow
      pip install opencv-python

  That's enough for this.
  Also, you need to clone this Repository, to do so, hit the following:
     
      git clone https://github.com/aslamanver/Logo-Classifier.git

  If you face so many error messages you can install virtual environment such as Anaconda:
  
      cd install
      conda env create -f environment.yml
      source activate tensorflow-p35
     
  I'm using OpenCV for taking a realtime images from the WebCamera and Identify that image from the retrained model!
  
  NOTE: You must have a WebCamera, If you choose webcam as your input device or you can choose an image from your directory and predict that.
       

* Run the application

  To run the classifier, hit the following:
  
      bash run.sh

* Select the image or cancel the file picker to activate camera
